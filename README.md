# WaterLinked-Underwater-GPS-G2

First we will set up the GPS itself, here are an outline of the steps in the process:
* Power the Topside unit
* Calibrate IMUs
* Deploying Antenna/Receivers
* Connect everything
* Select Locator and channel
* Configure Antenna/Receiver placement in GUI

Next we will set up the GoPro. For the conditions in cedar key, it is recommended to use --.
The GoPro is in the SKB case. Remove it, and connect it to the carbon fiber pole using one of the GoPro screws located within the case. Push the screw through the 
mounting holes until it makes it through both mounting holes, then begin screwing until tight.

The light is mounted on the back of the GoPro, to turn it on simply press the rubber button on top 3 times to get it to the brightest setting. TO shut it off, hold down the button.

1. A clear and complete protocol for setting up the underwater GPS and GoPro. For example, imagine that someone that has never used these two instruments has to use them one day, and all they have is your protocol. Make it easy for them.

* Beginning to write protocol for GPS setup, need to pickup GPS

2. The results of a small experiment for which filters, if any, and light to use on the GoPro in murky water. I want you to discuss your recommendations based on your observations.

* Will conduct experimentation on Sunday, ideally setting up camera saturday

3. Establish a relatively simple method to extract still frames from the GoPro video data.

* 

4. Establish a relatively simple workflow to mosaic/stitch the frames together. You can look online at existing tools for underwater video mosaicking for seabed mapping. Discuss the different tools you tried, if many.

*

5. Establish a relatively simple workflow to georeference the mosaic, meaning that you need to associate the underwater GPS data with the mosaic. We need to be able to open the mosaic in a GIS software.
